## Vidua Android Assignment

The solution proposed uses the following Android tech stack/libraries: 

- Coil for Async Image fetching
- MediaStore for fetching the images available on the user's device.
- Compose for UI
- Hilt for dependency injection
- A personal re-adaptation of MVI design pattern, to make it simpler and clean with Compose
- Coroutines/Flows for asynchronous operations. 

For the sack of simplicity and to keep it shorter in terms of time, the UI is quite simple, and no personalized launcher icons/app icons have been submitted. 
No unit tests have been provided, and no error handling has been provided to keep the project lite.
